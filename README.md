# Chatbot-Assignment

## About
This is my final project for my uni course at swinburne, it uses the flask, sqlalchemy, chatterbot and pandas python libraries to name a few. It also uses the Googlemaps and Openweather.org APIs.

## Setup
Unfortantly I can't give too much of a guide here as it's a bit messy, due to chatterbot being older this project was made using python 3.7.4. This has lead to some packages not being in sync with each other, in order to get this to work I had to uninstall and reinstall multiple packages at different versions until I finally found a solution that all worked. you may have to do the same, sorry in advance.

## Using the project
After you get things setup you can run the project in your ide of choice (this used pycharm), you can click on the the predefined locations or enter one manually. Additionally you can talk to a AI chatbot which has been trained on the recently collected weather data.
